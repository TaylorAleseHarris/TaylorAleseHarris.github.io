                            you need to successfully start up and run an aquarium. Beware though, something will most
                            likely
                            happen to you that happens to all aquarium owners who follow all of the steps listed on this
                            site.
                            It is called "Multiple Tank Syndrome". Once you get one up and going, you'll want more and
                            more, bigger and bigger.
                            Take it from me who has taken the hobby seriously for just over a year now. I've gone from
                            owning 1 aquarium to 6.
                            Good luck and have fun!

                        stock it with
                        fish right away! But there's something you need to do first to ensure your fish live
                        long,
                        healthy lives. Go ahead
                        and aquascape your aquarium (find out how to do that for your fish <a id="linkdecor"

                        the
                        beneficial bacteria have
                        surfaces to cling to and build colonies on.

                            <p class="layout-text">You should choose the substrate for your tank based on a couple
                                of factors. If you want to keep plants, what fish you're keeping, and how you would
                                like your tank to look.
                            </p>
                            <p class="layout-text"><b>So, what is substrate?</b> When it comes to aquariums, the
                                substrate refers to any loose material that makes up the bottom of your tank.
                                And it can be anything. If it’s loose and covers the bottom of your aquarium, it’s a
                                substrate.
                            </p>
                            <p class="layout-text"><b>Why do aquariums have a substrate?</b><br>
                                <b>1.</b> Good looking – The main reason people use a substrate is because it
                                enhances the look of the aquarium.
                                <br>
                                <b>2.</b> It’s natural – Do fish in the wild have a glass-bottomed habitat? No. By using
                                a substrate, you are creating a more natural environment for your fish.
                                <br>
                                <b>3.</b> Enhances your fish – You can use the substrate to make your fish pop. Dark
                                fish are easier to see on a light-colored substrate while light-colored fish are easier
                                to see on a dark substrate.
                                <br>
                                <b>4.</b> It houses bacteria – You know those beneficial bacteria that take part in the
                                nitrogen cycle? While the majority of them live in your filter, some also cover the
                                substrate of your aquarium. In fact, you can use the substrate from an established tank
                                to make a new aquarium cycle faster.
                                <br>
                                <b>5.</b> Plants need it – Plant roots need to go somewhere. Without a substrate, your
                                plants will float to the top of your tank.

                                            coarse to
                                            fine, and a wide range of colors, sand is a popular substrate choice.
                                            Sand is considered the most natural substrate since most aquarium fish are
                                            from
                                            an environment
                                            that has sand, silt or mud – all of which sand accurately replicates.
                                            Sand also has little to no gaps between each grain, meaning nowhere for
                                            uneaten
                                            food and poop to
                                            get stuck – making sand one of the easiest substrates to keep clean.<br>
                                            You can have rooted plants in sand, but because it houses no nutrients for
                                            the roots,
                                            you will need to also use root tabs. Root tabs are buried in the substrate
                                            near
                                            your plants' roots. Link to my favorite root tabs <a

                                            plants in your tank, then you should use a different substrate.
                                            You may have noticed that many of these substrate materials, such as pebbles
                                            and
                                            soil, can
                                            be
                                            found in your garden.
                                            However, unless you know what you are doing, you should only add
                                            store-bought
                                            substrates to
                                            your
                                            aquarium. These products have been tested and treated to ensure they
                                            are safe for your aquarium. The stuff in your garden could introduce bad
                                            bacteria,
                                            dust,
                                            chemicals and other nasties that could kill your fish. Play it safe and
                                            stick
                                            to store-bought substrates. Substrate soil from your local fish store is
                                            specially
                                            formulated to
                                            prevent it from mixing with water while also providing the nutrients
                                            necessary for your plants to grow.

                                        <p class="text-left"><b>Gravel</b> - You can think of gravel as small pea-sized
                                            pebbles. Measuring between
                                            2mm and
                                            5mm, gravel has a similar look to pebbles without the downside.
                                            Just like pebbles, gravel is available in a wide range of materials,
                                            allowing you to
                                            achieve
                                            nearly any substrate design that you can imagine.
                                            Because the gaps around each pebble are smaller, food and poop cannot fall
                                            as far.
                                            Any food
                                            that
                                            lands on gravel can be easily removed with a gravel vac during maintenance.

                                        <p class="text-left"><b>Pebbles</b> - The largest type of substrate used.
                                            Pebbles range in size from 6mm
                                            all the
                                            way
                                            up to 64mm.
                                            Pebbles can be made from almost any material that you can imagine – river
                                            rock,
                                            quartz,
                                            glass,
                                            and even colored plastic that glows in the dark. If the material does not
                                            impact the water quality, you can bet there is a pebble made from it. When
                                            layered,
                                            large
                                            gaps
                                            are left between each pebble.
                                            On their own, these gaps are not a problem. But over time, uneaten food and
                                            poop
                                            will fall
                                            between these gaps and build up.
                                            Not only does this look bad, but it also provides a feast for bacteria that
                                            produce
                                            nitrites,
                                            which are toxic to your fish.
                                            Also, due to the large gaps, plants have difficulty rooting in a pebble
                                            substrate.
                                            For beginners, if you want a rocky substrate, I recommend skipping pebbles
                                            and using
                                            gravel.

                            <p class="layout-text">You should choose the substrate for your tank based on a couple
                                of factors. If you want to keep plants, what fish you're keeping, and how you would
                                like your tank to look.
                            </p>
                            <p class="layout-text"><b>So, what is substrate?</b> When it comes to aquariums, the
                                substrate refers to any loose material that makes up the bottom of your tank.
                                And it can be anything. If it’s loose and covers the bottom of your aquarium, it’s a
                                substrate.
                            </p>
                            <p class="layout-text"><b>Why do aquariums have a substrate?</b><br>
                                <b>1.</b> Good looking – The main reason people use a substrate is because it
                                enhances the look of the aquarium.
                                <br>
                                <b>2.</b> It’s natural – Do fish in the wild have a glass-bottomed habitat? No. By using
                                a substrate, you are creating a more natural environment for your fish.
                                <br>
                                <b>3.</b> Enhances your fish – You can use the substrate to make your fish pop. Dark
                                fish are easier to see on a light-colored substrate while light-colored fish are easier
                                to see on a dark substrate.
                                <br>
                                <b>4.</b> It houses bacteria – You know those beneficial bacteria that take part in the
                                nitrogen cycle? While the majority of them live in your filter, some also cover the
                                substrate of your aquarium. In fact, you can use the substrate from an established tank
                                to make a new aquarium cycle faster.
                                <br>
                                <b>5.</b> Plants need it – Plant roots need to go somewhere. Without a substrate, your
                                plants will float to the top of your tank.

                                            fine, and a wide range of colors, sand is a popular substrate choice.
                                            Sand is considered the most natural substrate since most aquarium fish are
                                            from
                                            an environment
                                            that has sand, silt or mud – all of which sand accurately replicates.
                                            Sand also has little to no gaps between each grain, meaning nowhere for

                                            plants in your tank, then you should use a different substrate.
                                            You may have noticed that many of these substrate materials, such as pebbles
                                            and
                                            soil, can

                                            found in your garden.
                                            However, unless you know what you are doing, you should only add
                                            store-bought

                                            2mm and
                                            5mm, gravel has a similar look to pebbles without the downside.
                                            Just like pebbles, gravel is available in a wide range of materials,

                                            Because the gaps around each pebble are smaller, food and poop cannot fall
                                            as far.
                                            Any food

                                            Pebbles range in size from 6mm
                                            all the
                                            way
                                            up to 64mm.
                                            Pebbles can be made from almost any material that you can imagine – river
                                            rock,
                                            quartz,
                                            glass,
                                            and even colored plastic that glows in the dark. If the material does not
                                            impact the water quality, you can bet there is a pebble made from it. When
                                            layered,
                                            large
                                            gaps
                                            are left between each pebble.
                                            On their own, these gaps are not a problem. But over time, uneaten food and
                                            poop
                                            will fall
                                            between these gaps and build up.
                                            Not only does this look bad, but it also provides a feast for bacteria that
                                            produce
                                            nitrites,
                                            which are toxic to your fish.
                                            Also, due to the large gaps, plants have difficulty rooting in a pebble
                                            substrate.
                                            For beginners, if you want a rocky substrate, I recommend skipping pebbles
                                            and using
                                            gravel.
